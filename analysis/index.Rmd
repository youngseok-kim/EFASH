We consider an exponential family means problem. Suppose $x_j$'s are independently drawn from unknown mean $\mu_j$'s and known dispersion parameter $\tau_j$'s.

$$
x_j|\mu_j,\tau_j \sim A_j(x_j,\tau_j) \exp\left[-\tau_j D_G(x_j\|\mu_j) \right],\quad j=1,\cdots,n
$$

$A_j$ is a base measure and $D_G$ is a Bregman divergence generated by $G$.

We prefer to use a vectorized notation:

$$
x|\mu,\tau \sim A(x,\tau) \exp\left[ -\langle \tau, D_G(x\|\mu) \rangle \right]
$$

We introduce a scale mixture of conjugate priors:

$$
\mu_j|0,\phi,t \sim \sum_{k=1}^m \phi_k H(0,t_k) \exp\left[ -t_k D_G(0\|\mu_j) \right]
$$

where $H(0,t_k)$ is a partition function and $\phi_k$'s are mixture proportions.

More generally,

$$
\mu_j|\nu,\phi,t \sim \sum_{k=1}^m \phi_k H(\nu_k,t_k) \exp\left[ -t_k D_G(\nu_k\|\mu_j) \right]
$$
can be used.
